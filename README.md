# üöó Bluetooth Controlled RC Car (Arduino + HC-05 + L298N)

An Arduino-based **Bluetooth controlled RC car** using the HC-05 Bluetooth module, L298N motor driver, and DC motors powered by a lithium battery pack.  
Control the car wirelessly from your smartphone using simple commands.

## üìå Overview

- **Objective**: Build a DIY Bluetooth-controlled car using Arduino.  
- **Control**: Smartphone sends commands (`F`, `B`, `L`, `R`, `S`) via Bluetooth.  
- **Motors**: Two DC motors controlled with an L298N H-bridge driver.  
- **Power**: Lithium-ion battery pack powers Arduino + motors.  
- **Range**: Limited by Bluetooth (~10 meters).
